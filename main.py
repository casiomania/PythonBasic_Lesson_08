# Lesson 08 / Homework

# Important: do not use loops to implement the main logic.
# You must use recursion.
# The loop can be used only in 4 tasks to find the sum of numbers.
#
# Task 1.
# Write a recursive function for finding the degree of a number.
# Task 2.
# Write a recursive function that displays N stars in a row, the number N is given by the user.
# Illustrate the function with an example. (Test)
# Task 3.
# Write a recursive function that calculates the sum of all numbers in the range from a to b.
# The user enters a and b. Illustrate the operation of the function with an example.
# Optional:
# Task 4.
# Write a recursive function that takes a one-dimensional array of 100 randomly filled integers
# and finds the position from which the sequence of 10 numbers begins, whose sum is minimal.
